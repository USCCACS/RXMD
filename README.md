# rxmd : Linear Scalable Parallel ReaxFF Molecular Dynamics Simulator

**rxmd** has been developed to simulate large-scale Reactive Force Field molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on from commodity laptops to high-end supercomputing platforms. **rxmd** has been used in a various class of material studies, such as shock-induced chemical reactions, stress corrosion cracking, underwater bubble collapse, fracture of self-healing ceramics and oxidation of nanoparticles. 

## 0. Prerequisites

**rxmd** is designed to be simple, portable and minimally dependent on 3rd party library. You will need 1) a Fortran compiler that supports OpenMP, and 2) MPI (Message Passing Interface) library for parallel and distributed simulation. Modern Fortran compilers natively support OpenMP, and you can find many freely available MPI libraries online. Please refer to MPI library developer website about how to install their library. 

**rxmd** has been tested on following environments.

### - Fortan Compiler: 
```
GNU Fortran (GCC) 6.1.0
Intel Fortran (IFORT) 17.0.4
IBM XL Fortran V14.1
```
### - MPI library: 
```
OpenMPI 1.8.8
MPICH2
MVAPICH2 
Cray Mpich 7.6.0
```

## 1. Getting Started

To get started,  clone this repository to your computer. 
```
~$ git clone https://github.com/USCCACS/rxmd.git
```

## 2. How to build RXMD

### 2.1 Working Directory
Frist, change working directory to **rxmd/**
```
~$ cd rxmd-master
```
you will see following files and directories.

```
rxmd $ ls
DAT/          conf/         config/         ffield        regtests/     src/          util/
make.inc      Makefile      doc/          init/         rxmd.in       unittests/
```

Here, two directories, **src/** and **init/**, are especially important for you. **src/** contains all rxmd source codes and **init/** has a program and input files to generate an initial configurations for simulation. 

### 2.2 Configure Makefiles

There is an important file called **make.inc** that you might need to modify according to your computing environment. 

- **make.inc** defines which compiler you like to use to build the **rxmd** and **geninit** executable. **geninit** is created inside **init/** directory and is used to generate intial configuration for simulation.

- **config/** directory contains an example **make.inc** file called **make_example.inc**, and several other make.inc (make_hpc.inc,make_xl.inc) file containing predefined compiler settings for various machines. Copy the approprite file from **config/** inside the rxmd directory as make.inc. Each make.inc file has several compiler flags options. Enable the flags that you want use, and also do not forget disable macros you don't want to use. 

- **FC** variable in **make.inc**  is used to build software to generate intial configuration, called **geninit**. Any Fortran or MPI compiler that supports [the stream I/O](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19205-01/819-5262/aeuca/index.html) can be used here. 

- **Makefile** contains commands to create the executable **geninit** and **rxmd**. For example, **make all** creates the executable **geninit** inside the the init folder and **rxmd** inside rxmd directory. Whereas, **make init** creates only the executable **geninit**  and  **make rxmd** creates **rxmd** executable.

- Each **init** and **src** has **Makefile** containing commands to create the executable **geninit** and **rxmd**, respectively. **Makefile** in rxmd directory calls these files to create the necessary executables.

Example 1) Linux Computer with Intel Compiler

Many HPC centers have Intel Fortran compiler and its MPI binding installed. If this is the case, copy the **make_hpc.inc** from **config/** as **make.inc**. It should look as shown below

- **make.inc** 
```
# Intel Compiler
MPIF90 = mpif90
FC = ifort
```

### 2.3 Prepare Initial Geometry

Next step is to generate initial MD geometry. Type the make command shown below. 

```
rxmd $ make -C init/
```

This compiles the standalone application **geninit**, read a geometry file (init.xyz by default) in **init/** directory, replicate the geometry and save the entire initial MD geometry into **rxff.bin** file, and then place **rxff.bin** file in **DAT/** directory. 

### 2.4 Build RXMD

Type the command below to build the **rxmd** executable.

```
rxmd $ make -C src/
```

Check to see if you the **rxmd** executable and the initial geomerty input **DAT/rxff.bin** in place, then you are ready to start a simulation.

```
rxmd $ ls
DAT/          conf/         ffield        regtests/     rxmd.in       unittests/
Makefile.inc  doc/          init/         rxmd*         src/          util/
```
```
rxmd $ ls DAT/
rxff.bin
```
## 3. CMake options
+ General build options
    + `CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER` Specify the executable for compiling Fortran files
    + `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` Specify the executable for compiling C++ files 
+ RXMD build options
    + `RXMD_ENABLE_MPI` Set this variable to on `ON` (default) to compile for distributed parallelization with MPI.  Otherwise set to `OFF`.
    + `RXMD_ENABLE_TORCH` Set this variable to `ON` to use PyTorch libraries for machine learning tasks. Set to `OFF` by default
    + `RXMD_ENABLE_IPEX` Set this variable to `ON` to optimized features for Intel hardware. Set to `OFF` by default.
	
## 4. How to run

Default input parameters are set to run a single process job. In **rxmd.in**, the parameter **vprocs** defines how many MPI ranks in x, y, and z directions. Make sure you have **1 1 1** here. 

```
rxmd $ grep vprocs rxmd.in 
1 1 1                <vprocs>
```

To run single MPI rank job on a typical Linux computer, you can simply type
```
rxmd $ ./rxmd
```

How to run a multi process job depends on which MPI library you use, but most likely **mpirun** just works for you. 

```
rxmd $ mpirun -np nprocessors ./rxmd
```

If you see following outputs, congratulations! You have everything working.

```
rxmd $ ./rxmd 
              rxmd has started
